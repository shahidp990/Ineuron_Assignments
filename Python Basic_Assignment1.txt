1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
	integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
	
	* --> Expression
	'hello'-->Values
	-87.8-->Values
	- -->Expression
	/-->Expression
	+ -->Expression
	6 ->Values
	
	
	
2. What is the difference between string and variable?

	String--> In any computer programming language, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
			For Example, 'hello', 'shahid'

3. Describe three different data types:
	Different Data types: Float, Char, Int, String
	
4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
    In programming, an expression is a value, or anything that executes and ends up being a value.
	Expressions evaluates a value.
	
5. Expression is itself has a mathematical operators.
  While statement is a sentence having variable value or fixed value assigned to different fixed value using mathematical operators.
  
 6. bacon=22
 
 7. 
   'spam'+'spamspam'==> This will give an error.
   'spam'*3--> 'spamspamspam'

8. 'Eggs' is a variable because it may contain any value. While 100 is a fixed value.

9. int(3.1416)
	Float(3.1416)
	String('3.1416')
	
10. 'I have eaten'+99+'burritos'
This expression will give an error because we can not add string to numbers.
